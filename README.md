# Map-Visualizations-with-Plotly-Express
This repository contains interactive visualizations for global data using Plotly. The visualizations include:

1. **Global Population Density (2007)**: A scatter plot showing population density by country based on the Gapminder dataset.
2. **Alcohol Consumption (2010)**: A scatter plot showing alcohol consumption by country.
3. **Busiest Airports by Passenger Traffic (2022)**: This project visualizes the top 50 busiest airports worldwide by passenger traffic in 2022 using Plotly.
## Visualizations

### 1. Global Population Density (2007)

This visualization shows the population density of countries in 2007. The data is sourced from the Gapminder dataset.

**Features:**
- Color-coded by continent.
- Marker size represents the amount of alcohol consumption.
- Natural Earth projection.
- Interactive tooltips displaying country names and population.

### 2. Alcohol Consumption (2010)

This visualization shows alcohol per country in 2010. The data is sourced from CSV file.

**Features:**
- Marker size represents the population of each country.
- Natural Earth projection.
- Interactive tooltips displaying country names and alcohol consumption.
- Customized appearance with various geographic features highlighted.

### 3. Busiest Airports by Passenger Traffic (2022)
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes information about the busiest airports by passenger traffic.
The latitude and longitude values for each airport were manually added to the dataset to enable geographical plotting.
**Datasource:**
List of Busiest Airports by Passenger Traffic on Kaggle
**Prerequisites:**
To run the project, you'll need:
-Python 3.x
-Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
